You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you
pick one game or the other?



Answer:
The probability of successful two shots is C(2/3) * p² * (1-p) = 3p²(1-p)
The probalility of successful three shots is p * p * p = p³

If we pick Game 1:
3p²(1-p) + p³ < p
=> (p-1)(2p-1) > 0
because p < 1, so, p < 0.5

So,
If p < 0.5, we should pick Game 1;
If p = 0.5, it doesn't matter.
If p > 0.5, we should pick Game 2.
