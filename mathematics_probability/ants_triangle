There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of
collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the
triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction
being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed.
Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.



Answer:
Two ways to avoid collision: clockwise and counter clockwise
The probability of clockwise is 1/2*1/2*1/2 = 1/8
The probability of counter clockwise is 1/2*1/2*1/2 = 1/8
So, the probability of collision is: 1-1/8*1/8 = 3/4

For an n-vertex polygon:
1-(1/2)^n-1
