You have two ropes, and each takes exactly one hour to burn. How would you use them
to time exactly 15 minutes? Note that the ropes are of uneven densities, so half the rope
length-wise does not necessarily take half an hour to burn.



Answer:
1. Light Rope 1 at both ends and Rope 2 at one end.
2. When two flames on Rope 1 meet(we know it's already 30 minutes), light Rope 2 at the other end.
3. In exactly 15 minutes, Rope 2 will be completely burnt.
