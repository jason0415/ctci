You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight
1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find
the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.



Answer:
1. Take 1 pill from Bottle 1, 2 pills from Bottle 2, .... 20 pills from Bottle 20
2. Number of the heavy bottle will be (weight - 210) / 0.1

Sum of the arithmetic progression is n*(a1+an)/2
