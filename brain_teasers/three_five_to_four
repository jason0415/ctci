You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water
(but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of
water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half"of
the jug would be impossible.



Answer:
1. Fill 3-quart jug, pull all water from 3-quart jug to 5-quart jug.
2. Fill 3-quart jug, pull water from 3-quart jug to 5-quart jug until 5-quart jug is full.
   Now, we have 1-quart water in 3-quart jug.
3. Pull all water out of the 5-quart jug and put the 1-quart water from the 3-quart jug to 5-quart jug.
4. Fill 3-quart jug, pull all water from 3-quart jug to the 5-quart jug.
   Now, in the 5-quart jug we have 4-quart water.
