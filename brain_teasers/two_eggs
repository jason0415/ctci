There is a building of 100 floors. In an egg drops from the nth floor or above, it will
break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You're given two eggs.
Find n, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.



Answer:
x + (x-1) + (x-2) + ... + 1 = 100.
=> x â‰ˆ 14

We go to floor 14, then 27, then 39, ....This takes 14 steps in the worse case.
