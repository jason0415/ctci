Imagine you are building some sort of service that will be called by up to 1000
client applications to get simple end-of-day stock price information (open,
close, high, low). You may assume that you already have the data, and you can
store it in any format you wish. How would you design the client-facing service
which provides the information to client applications? You are responsible
for the development, rollout, and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of
the feed. Describe the different methods you considered and why you would
recommend your approach. Your service can use any technologies you wish,
and can distribute the information to the client applications in any mechanism
you choose.



1. keep the data in simple text files and let clients download
the data through some sort of FTP server
pros: easy to maintain; backup
cons: complex to query; break the parsing if adding more data

2. SQL server
pros: easy to query; backup; not break the parsing if adding more data
cons: heavy, difficult for human to read

3. XML through SOAP
pros: easy to query; easy for human to read; easy to parse; backup;
cons: send all data to a client; need to parsing the entire file;
      break the parsing if adding more data
